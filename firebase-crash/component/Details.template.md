Firebase - Crash Reporting
==========================

Comprehensive and actionable information to help diagnose and fix problems in your app.

Crash Reporting creates detailed reports of the errors in your app. Errors are grouped into clusters of similar stack traces and triaged by the severity of impact on your users. In addition to automatic reports, you can log custom events to help capture the steps leading up to a crash.

## Key capabilities

 - **Monitor fatal and non-fatal errors** Reports are triaged by the severity of impact on users.

 - **Collect the data you need to diagnose problems** Each report contains a full stack trace as well as device characteristics, performance data, and user circumstances when the error took place. Similar reports are automatically clustered to make it easier to identify related bugs.

 - **Integrate with Analytics** Errors captured are set as app_exception events in Analytics, allowing you to filter audiences based on who sees errors.

 - **Free and easy** Crash Reporting is free to use. Once you've added Firebase to your app, it's just a few lines of code to enable comprehensive error reporting.
