Firebase - Storage
==========================

Firebase Storage is built for app developers who need to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos or videos.

Firebase Storage adds Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality. You can use it to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. Firebase Storage is backed by Google Cloud Storage, a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service.
